<p>Before installing the Android NDK, you must agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>
<div class="sdk-terms" style="width:auto" onfocus="this.blur()">
<h2 class="norule">Terms and Conditions</h2>
This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in this License Agreement as the "SDK" and
specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
licensed to you subject to the terms of this License Agreement. This License Agreement forms a
legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

1.2 “Android” means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android
Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated
from time to time.

1.3 "Google" means Google Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at 1600
Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


<h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to this License Agreement. You may not use the
SDK if you do not accept this License Agreement.

2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of this License Agreement.

2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred
from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country
in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by this License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other
entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such
entity to this License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept
the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


<h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
3.1 Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the SDK solely to develop
applications to run on the Android platform.

3.2 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law,
and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

3.3 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by this License Agreement.
Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not: (a) copy (except for
backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create
derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK; or (b) load any part of the SDK onto a mobile
handset or any other hardware device except a personal computer, combine any part of the SDK with
other software, or distribute any software or device incorporating a part of the SDK.

3.4 You agree that you will not take any actions that may cause or result in the fragmentation of
Android, including but not limited to distributing, participating in the creation of, or promoting
in any way a software development kit derived from the SDK.

3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open source
software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not this
License Agreement.

3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior
notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed
on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily)
providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole
discretion, without prior notice to you.

3.7 Nothing in this License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including
copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.


<h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under
this License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a)
this License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or
guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will
protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names,
passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that
the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate
privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with
Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's
Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
do so.

4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or
distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an
unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party
including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or
to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display
through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
(including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or
to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under this License Agreement, any applicable
third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the
consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such
breach.


<h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will
be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.


<h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the SDK
are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the SDK
will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
collected.

6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


<h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content
or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which
you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from
which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience
as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
resources.

7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers
(or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole
or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may
be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, this License
Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.


<h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
8.1 Google Data APIs

8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be
subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or
create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the
relevant Terms of Service.

8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you
shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited
purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.


<h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
9.1 This License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as set
out below.

9.2 If you want to terminate this License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK
and any relevant developer credentials.

9.3 Google may at any time, terminate this License Agreement with you if:
(A) you have breached any provision of this License Agreement; or
(B) Google is required to do so by law; or
(C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has terminated
its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or
(D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the country
in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the SDK or certain
SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable.

9.4 When this License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over
time whilst this License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


<h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE
SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE.

10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE
SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR
COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


<h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>

against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or
accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes
any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of

<h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
14.1 This License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in
relation to the SDK.

14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is

this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies
will still be available to Google.

14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
provision of this License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from this

  <p>Select, from the table below, the NDK package for your development platform. For information
  about the changes in the newest version of the NDK, see <a href="#rel">Release Notes</a>. For
  information about earlier revisions, see <a href="../../ndk/downloads/revision_history.html">
  NDK Revision History.</a></p>


<h2 id="Downloads">Downloading</h2>


<script>
$('#Downloads').after($('#download-table'));
</script>

  <h2 id="extract">Extraction</h2>
  <p>The NDK package is a self-extracting binary. To unpack it, follow the procedure for your
  development platform:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>On Linux and Mac OS X (Darwin):
          <ul>
          <ol>
          <li>Download the appropriate package from this page.</li>
          <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
          <li>Go to the directory to which you downloaded the package.</li>
          <li>Run <code>chmod a+x</code> on the downloaded package.</li>
          <li>Execute the package. For example:
          <pre class="no-pretty-print">
ndk$ chmod a+x android-ndk-r10c-darwin-x86_64.bin
ndk$ ./android-ndk-r10c-darwin-x86_64.bin
          </pre></li>
          <p>The folder containing the NDK extracts itself.</p>
          <p>You can also use a program like 7z to extract the package.</p>
          </ol>
          </ul>
       </li>
    <li>On Windows:</li>
       <ul>
       <ol>
       <li>Download the appropriate package from this page.</li>
       <li>Navigate to the folder to which you downloaded the package.</li>
       <li>Double-click the downloaded file. The folder containing the NDK extracts itself.</li>
       </ol>
       </ul>
     </ul>When uncompressed, the NDK files are contained in a directory called
    <code>android-ndk-&lt;version&gt;</code>. You can rename the NDK directory if necessary and you
    can move it to any location on your computer. This documentation refers to the NDK directory as
    <code>&lt;ndk&gt;</code>.


  <p>You are now ready to start working with the NDK.</p>

<h2 id="rel">Release Notes</h2>

 <p>Android NDK, Revision 10e</a> <em>(May 2015)</em></p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Important changes:</dt>
      <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrated the workaround for Cortex-A53 Erratum 843419 into the
        <code>aarch64-linux-android-4.9</code> linker. For more information on this workaround, see
        <a href="https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2015-03/msg00446.html">Workaround for cortex-a53
        erratum 843419.</a></li>

         <li>Added Clang 3.6; <code>NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION=clang</code> now picks that version
         of Clang by default.</li>

         <li>Removed Clang 3.4.</li>

         <li>Removed GCC 4.6.</li>

         <li>Implemented multithreading support in <code>ld.gold</code> for all architectures. It can
         now link with or without support for multithreading; the default is to do it without.
            <ul>
            <li>To compile with multithreading, use the <code>--threads</code> option.</li>
            <li>To compile without multithreading, use the <code>--no-threads</code> option.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

         <li>Upgraded GDB/gdbserver to 7.7 for all architectures.</li>

         <li>Removed the NDK package for 32-bit Darwin.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
   <dl>


     <dt>Important bug fixes:</dt>
     <dd>
     <ul>
        <li>Fixed a crash that occurred when there were OpenMP loops outside of the main thread.</li>

        <li>Fixed a GCC 4.9 internal compiler error (<i>ICE</i>) that occured when the user declared
        <code>#pragma GCC optimize ("O0")</code>, but had a different level of optimization specified
        on the command line. The <code>pragma</code> takes precedence.</li>

        <li>Fixed an error that used to produce a crash with the following error message:
<pre>
in add_stores, at var-tracking.c:6000
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Implemented a workaround for a Clang 3.5 issue in which LLVM auto-vectorization
        generates <code>llvm.cttz.v2i64()</code>, an instruction with no counterpart in the ARM
        instruction set.</li>
     </ul>
     </dd>

     <dt>Other bug fixes:</dt>
     <dd>
     <ul>
        <li>Made the following header and library fixes:</li>
           <ul>
           <li>Fixed <code>PROPERTY_*</code> in <code>media/NdkMediaDrm.h</code>.</li>
           <li>Fixed <code>sys/ucontext.h</code> for <code>mips64</code>.</li>
           <li>Dropped the Clang version check for <code>__builtin_isnan</code> and
           <code>__builtin_isinf</code>.</li>
           <li>Added <code>android-21/arch-mips/usr/include/asm/reg.h</code>
           and <code>android-21/arch-mips64/usr/include/asm/reg.h</code>.</li>
           </ul>
           </li>

        <li>Fixed a spurious array-bounds warning that GCC 4.9 produced for x86, and reenabled the
        array bounds warning that GCC 4.9 had produced for ARM. The warning for ARM had
        previously been unconditionally disabled.</li>

        <li>Fixed Clang 3.5 for <code>mips</code> and <code>mips64</code> to create a writable
            <code>.gcc_except_table</code> section, thus matching GCC behavior. This change allows you
            to avoid the following linker warning:

<pre>
.../ld: warning: creating a DT_TEXTREL in a shared object
</pre>
            </li>

        <li>Backported a fix for <code>compiler-rt</code> issues that were causing crashes when Clang
        compiled for <code>mips64</code>. For more information, see LLVM Issue
        <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20098">20098</a>.</li>

        <li>Fixed Clang 3.5 crashes that occurred on non-ASCII comments. (Issue
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81440">81440</a>)</li>

        <li>Fixed <code>stlport collate::compare</code> to return <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code>. Previously,
        it had returned arbitrary signed numbers.</li>

        <li>Fixed <code>ndk-gdb</code> for 64-bit ABIs. (Issue
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=118300">118300</a>)</li>

        <li>Fixed the crash that the HelloComputeNDK sample for RenderScript was producing on
        Android 4.4 (Android API level 19). For more information, see
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28057049/targeting-pre-lollipop-devices-using-renderscript-from-ndk-c">this page</a>.</li>

        <li>Fixed <code>libc++ __wrap_iter</code> for GCC. For more information, see LLVM Issue
        <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=22355">22355</a>.</li>

        <li>Fixed <code>.asm</code> support for ABI <code>x86_64</code>.</li>

        <li>Implemented a workaround for the GCC 4.8 <code>stlport</code> issue. (Issue
        <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/127773">127773</a>)</li>

        <li>Removed the trailing directory separator <code>\\</code> from the project path in Windows.
        (Issue <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=160584">160584</a>)
        </li>

        <li>Fixed a <code>no rule to make target</code> error that occurred when compiling a single
        <code>.c</code> file by executing the <code>ndk-build.cmd</code> command from <code>gradle</code>. (Issue
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=66937">66937</a>)</li>

        <li>Added the <code>libatomic.a</code> and <code>libgomp.a</code> libraries that had been missing from
        the following host toolchains:
        <ul>
           <li><code>aarch64-linux-android-4.9</code></li>
           <li><code>mips64el-linux-android-4.9</code></li>
           <li><code>mipsel-linux-android-4.9</code></li>
           <li><code>x86_64-4.9</code></li>
        </ul>
     </ul>
     </dd>

     <dt>Other changes:</dt>
     <dd>
       <ul>
       <li>Added <code>ld.gold</code> for <code>aarch64</code>. The default linker remains <code>ld.bfd</code>.
       To explicitly enable <code>ld.gold</code>, add <code>-fuse-ld=gold</code> to the
       <code>LOCAL_LDFLAGS</code> or <code>APP_LDFLAGS</code> variable.</li>

       <li>Built the MIPS and MIPS64 toolchains with <code>binutils-2.25</code>, which provides improved
       R6 support.</li>

       <li>Made <code>-fstandalone-debug</code> (full debug info) a default option for Clang.</li>

       <li>Replaced <code>-fstack-protector</code> with <code>-fstack-protector-strong</code> for
       the ARM, AArch64, X86, and X86_64 toolchains for GCC 4.9, Clang 3.5, and
       Clang 3.6.</li>

       <li>Added the <code>--package</code> command-line switch to <code>ndk-gdb</code> to allow the build
       system to override the package name. (Issue
       <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=56189">56189</a>)</li>

       <li> Deprecated <code>-mno-ldc1-stc1</code> for MIPS.  This option may not work with the new
       <code>-fpxx</code> and <code>-mno-odd-spreg</code> options, or with the FPXX ABI.</li>

       <li>Added MIPS MSA and R6 detection to <code>cpu-features</code>.</li>

     </ul>
